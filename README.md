# webview\_flutter\_android

The Android implementation of [`webview_flutter`][1].

## Usage

This package is [endorsed][2], which means you can simply use `webview_flutter`
normally. This package will be automatically included in your app when you do.

## Contributing

This package uses [pigeon][3] to generate the communication layer between Flutter and the host
platform (Android). The communication interface is defined in the `pigeons/android_webview.dart`
file. After editing the communication interface regenerate the communication layer by running
`flutter pub run pigeon --input pigeons/android_webview.dart`.

Due to [flutter/flutter#97744](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/97744), the generated test
pigeon file needs one of its imports updated to properly work with `mockito`.

In `test/android_webview.pigeon.dart`, change

```dart
import '../lib/src/android_webview.pigeon.dart';
```

to

```dart
import 'package:webview_flutter_android/src/android_webview.pigeon.dart';
```

Besides [pigeon][3] this package also uses [mockito][4] to generate mock objects for testing
purposes. To generate the mock objects run the following command:
```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
